I recently heard about the book [Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40406806-coders). The author [described us](https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/03/27/coders-programming-algorithm-clive-thompson) so well that I woke up the dog laughing. The part that caught my mind the most was how we’ve changed our minds to consider the pedantic nature of telling a machine what to do. We consider all of the steps and think about the fastest way for a computer to do things. We break down problems to their core so we’re solving for the right thing. We think about being efficient with our code. Then that kind of efficiency bleeds into our brains and into other parts of our lives, which leads to good, and often ridiculous adventures.

It made me laugh because it’s the essence of how I see my world. The steps I need to take, in the most efficient order to use the least time so I can sleep in the longest in the morning. The planning around training my dog, each step, keeping it all consistent so she understands what to do. In every context, under every condition I can think of. It gets a little dicey with my children. They’re not efficient creatures by nature. It’s a balance: my need for order and efficiency and their need to explore their world at their speed within their perspective.

Naturally, the software-engineer-in-the-real-world “lifehacker” mentality had my mind going elsewhere: “100 years ago, what would i have been?” What about 200 years ago? And what about the time when the Roman Empire was at its largest?

## Values
The software engineer values solving the right problem efficiently and concisely. Personally, I also value improvement, aspiring to be better every day. What was the world like and where would we have fit in? Let’s assume those values remain intact. 

Another aspect I’m struggling with is gender. As a woman, my opportunities would have been limited in these periods, except perhaps as a hunter-gatherer. For this game, we will consider both men and women because I cannot ignore these differences.

## Post-industrial, Pre-Turing
1920. World War I is over and cars and radios are becoming more and more commonplace. Movies are a thing, and household appliances are making their way into upper- and middle-class homes. Roads are being paved, highways are starting to become more common. What would we be up to?

Well, if you're a woman, I bet you're a telephone switchboard operator. You could also be a teacher, be running a store (but probably not own it), a tailor. A tailor? Really? Lots of problems to solve there. How do you make clothes faster, but with quality? How do you make custom items fit just so? How about making clothes to fit a certain profession, say, assembly line workers who need hard hats. There wasn't much plastic in 1920, so how would you solve for that?

If you're a man, you're probably on an assembly line, making some new gadget: a car, a radio, an appliance. If you're rich, you could be a civil enineer, someone who designs those assembly lines.

You could also be a gangster working on efficiencies around keeping prohibition America well-liquored. So many options!

## Antebellum Period, Pre-Ada Lovelace
1820. Unless you're born into a rich family, it's likely you're working very, very hard. With your hands. Surely there's a place for an efficiency-minded person in any number of the common fields of the day: blacksmiths, clockmakers, mill operators, printers.

If you're a woman, you're probably not participating in the workforce. 

Also, while we're thinking about it, remember there'a good chance that if you were born in 1800, you wouldn't have survived to adulthood.
