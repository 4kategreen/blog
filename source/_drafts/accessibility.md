Failing at basic accessibility standards means you're not only failing users with disabilities. The tools that make a product accessible make it more straightforward for everyone.

Often, accessibility is looked down on becaue it's challenging, but there are many reasons to address it from the start of a product's development. If you are testing an application that needs accreditation or will be part of a(n American) government system, this will matter way more. The main things here are: straightforward structure so screen readers can navigate, sane color contrast for colorblind and low vision users, and forms that tab through easily for keyboard and screenreader users. Often these bugs show up as usability and look-and-feel, so I could make an argument that these three sections could be combined.

* Color contrast
* Screen reader usability
* Simple layout
* Easy-to-use forms
