title: Understanding Intent in Problem Solving

The first thing I try to figure out when someone meets with me to talk testing is what they really want. Finding the "why" behind their idea illuminates much more than tests, and many times I find myself sending them someplace else to solve the "real" problem. 

## A Single Question
The first thing I seek to understand is the question they are trying to answer with their idea. 

Common types of tests have common questions behind them:
* Does the API send responses within the validation schema?
* Does our list of products sort and filter as expected?
* Does our form validation do the job against _all_ characters?

It gets the most interesting when you come across an idea dug in so deeply in complication that you're sure you'll need to write a whole slew of new code to handle it.

* Why do purchases not match what we quoted a customer? (_oh shit_, I think to myself.)

the process could be used to distill anything down to its base, so i'm presenting it as a non-technical idea that can be applied to technical problems.
the idea of surfacing what someone wants to figure out, trying to find the root of the issue, evaluating the best means of helping them figure it out
so like the tracks testing idea. they want a big old e2e test cuz the engineers never do tracks right.
(which :face_with_rolling_eyes: but hear me out)
so i pulled all the way back to the idea of DS getting involved and the process by which engineers are doing tracks because there's a lot more wins to be had at that level than there is in a big, brittle e2e test. though i will also do that, but the truth is that the problem isn't that we need this big test. it's that DS feels like no one is listening and that they are the reason we'll be successful.
which is straight hubris if you ask me, but
but i could also play this idea off communication issues between partners, evaluating how to get good behavior from your kid (or dog), or figuring out a path forward as a family in a difficult situation. i'm thinking of my grandfather and our efforts toward the end last year to support each other.
also policy, macro economics, etc. still lots of unknowns in the large scale application of the idea, but the idea of trying to get to the base of a problem to then apply solutions is so important.
thank you for helping me write a little bit more this morning, my friend.
