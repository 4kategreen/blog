The first thing I try to figure out when someone meets with me to talk testing is what they really want. Finding the "why" behind their idea illuminates much more than tests, and many times I find myself sending them someplace else to solve the "real" problem. 

## A Single Question
The first thing I seek to understand is the question they are trying to answer with their idea. 

Common types of tests have common questions behind them:
* Does the API send responses within the validation schema?
* Does our list of products sort and filter as expected?
* Does our form validation do the job against _all_ characters?

It gets the most interesting when you come across an idea dug in so deeply in complication that you're sure you'll need to write a whole slew of new code to handle it.

* Why do purchases not match what we quoted a customer? (_oh shit_, I think to myself.)
