## Tech
* Phone: iPhone X
* Tablet: iPad Pro (the 9” model they don’t make anymore). It takes over
* Laptop: MacBookPro 13”
* Withings for body tracking. I have a Steel HR and a Body+ scale and I love them both. And a Sleep, which I don't love but it is consistent night over night.

## Thinking and Stress Management
* iPad + Apple Pencil. Seriously, it changed how I keep track of my thoughts
* Blog: hexo + netlify = magic
* Meditation. I like [Balance](https://balanceapp.com).
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/three/) to organize the things
* Ironclad routines. I have a list of things I do every week under the heading “Sisyphus” in Things.

## Leadership
* Brene Brown's [Dare to Lead](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/)
* Lara Hogan's [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com/)

## Parenting
My philosphy is to encourage open-ended play, lots of physical movement, and be sure my children get the sleep and emotional support and safety they need to thrive. I model my parenting after Unschooling and John Holt's teachings, as well as the very precise method of "Doing Mostly the Opposite of What my Parents Did."

Things I rely on are:
* Legos, blocks, Brio trains
* The [Happiest Baby](https://www.happiestbaby.com/collections/books-dvds-more) books
* [How to Listen So Your Kids Will Talk](https://fabermazlish.com/)

## Anti-Racism
* [So You Want to Talk about Race](http://www.ijeomaoluo.com/)
* [How to be an Anti-Racist](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/)
* [White Fragility](https://robindiangelo.com/)

## Workout
* Polar M400 watch
* [Polar OH1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PM6JDZ8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_pL7MEbZ6ZJDV2) Bluetooth ANT+ heart rate monitor
* [Nike Training](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app) for quick workouts and yoga sessions

## Garden

* [Seed Savers Exchange](https://seedsavers.org) for almost all my seeds
* LED Growlight to start seeds
* Raised beds, mostly cuz I like it organized enough...
* ...but I garden by taking what my gardens give me. If you grow in my garden and I like you, I’ll let you stick around. Especially if you make my life easier. See: the same garden bed in 2020 and then in 2018.

## Dogs
* Positive reinforcement and teaching over all else.
* Ruthlessly asking the question "what are you rewarding for?"
* Denise Fenzi and Deb Jones's [Dog Sports Skills](https://www.dogwise.com/dog-sports-skills-series-book-1-2-3-and-4/) Series
* Dog agility

## Chickens
* Southern States feed, augmented with [Fresh Eggs Daily](https://www.fresheggsdaily.blog) recommendations
* Hardware cloth. Lots of hardware cloth. We have foxes and it's a necessity to keep them safe.
