## Tech
* Phone: iPhone X
* Tablet: iPad Pro (the 9” model they don’t make anymore). It takes over
* Laptop: MacBookPro 13”
* Withings for body tracking. I have a Steel HR and a Body+ scale and I love them both. And a Sleep, which is only sorta okay.

## Thinking
* iPad + Apple Pencil. Seriously, it changed how I keep track of my thoughts
* Blog: hexo + minos theme + netlify = magic
* Meditation. I like [Balance](https://balanceapp.com).

## Making it all happen
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/three/) to organize the things
* Ironclad routines. I have a list of things I do every week under the heading “Sisyphus” in Things.

## Workout
* Polar M400 watch (which is old and stuff, but still does the job).
* [Polar OH1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PM6JDZ8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_pL7MEbZ6ZJDV2) Bluetooth ANT+ heart rate monitor
* Right now, it’s strength + walking + yoga over my preferred running. It used to be softball and hockey, too, but back surgeries and babies make that harder.
* I like Nike Training for quick workouts.

## Garden
* [Seed Savers Exchange](https://seedsavers.org) for almost all my seeds
* LED Growlight to start seeds
* Raised beds, mostly cuz I like it organized enough...
* ...but I garden by volunteer. If you grow in my garden and I like you, I’ll let you stick around. Especially if you make my life easier. See: the massive butterfly bush I didn’t mean to grow.

## Dogs
* Positive reinforcement and teaching over all else. Clicker training
* Dog agility
    * AKC
    * One Mind Dogs, for training ideas
    * NADAC

## Chickens
* Southern States feed, augmented with...
* [Fresh Eggs Daily](https://www.fresheggsdaily.blog) recommendations
