# I am Kate Green.
## I code. And a lot of other things. 

I'm a software engineering leader who specializes in designing and implementing test automation. I love making quality software that solves real problems. I love working with other engineers to raise the quality of the products, from the code on out. However, I'm flexible enough to know when something is good enough. I love to teach and speak at conferences when I have the time.

In other parts of my life, I parent, train and compete with my dogs, entertain and boss around two little boys, work out, garden, and occasionally sleep.
