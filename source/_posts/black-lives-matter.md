2020 has brought many life-changing events and here we sit with another one. The killing of George Floyd has sent us into a civil rights moment that I've never seen in my lifetime. I have hope that attitudes are changing among white people. #BlackLivesMatter is mainstream and white people are speaking out in numbers I haven't seen, but there's still work to be done. 

The intent of my post is to talk about the role I've assigned myself and give ideas for other white people to continue the work we must do to eliminate systematic racism.

## Where I Am Today
This isn't a new topic of importance for me. My core values are kindness, building community, and realizing potential in everyone. I have believed for the better part of my life that there is much work to be done to make it so everyone has the chance to realize their own potential.

I didn't always feel this way. Despite growing up and attending public schools in a very diverse area of Maryland, my parents were racist (and homophobic and patriarchical). It was hard to grow up without overt racist views where people regularly disparaged all the "others" the 1980s and 1990s had to offer. My racism included expecting that Black people were less smart than me, that Latinx people took jobs from my dad, and that affirmative action was cheating White people. I most definitely asked why there wasn't a White Student Union at the University of Maryland. A few life changing moments helped me to shift my thinking. 

### "I'm Not Racist"
The first was a class I took from John Splaine about the history of education. He was a fabulous teacher who encouraged psychological safety in his classes. People were comfortable speaking out, which made the weekly discussions very interesting. He also brought in all sorts of people to talk to us. Education reporters, veteran teachers, and people from the business community. It was a successful man from the business community who grew up poor that sticks in my mind the most. He declared to us that he was not racist. The class, somewhat diverse in its makeup, pounced on that statement. "How can anyone not be racist in this country?" they asked. "It's impossible."

That moment stuck with me. I fully agreed that we are all racist and that it was part of growing up in the US. I knew that I should never believe that I'm not racist and that belief has stayed with me for over 20 years. 

### Lost Potential
Another way I've learned to believe racism is built into the community is by comparing the sexism I've experienced both in regular society and as the only woman in many activities. Now, **racism and sexism are _very_ different**, but they do relate in how they both limit the opportunities both groups get. Because I value realizing potential so highly, it was perfectly obvious to me after 5 years in the technology industry that we weren't giving enough people a chance and thus were losing out on the potential of those of us who were underestimated.

I spent time asking questions of Black people who were patient and kind. They helped me to see things I otherwise wouldn't, and likely tolerated some very dumb, racist questions.

### Seeing Through to Structural Racism
Trayvon and Michael Brown both had a big impact on me. Young people doing normal young people things, and yet they were murdered. Their deaths, so senseless, caused me to start researching the history and effects of racism and caused me to start to speak up.

## My Own Voice
That brings us to today, where I am trying to find my voice as a white ally. The balance I find myself attempting is this:

* Amplifying Black voices, not just on the topic of racism. Also seeking to use my privilege as a white woman to give opportunities where they might otherwise not.
* Listening to Black people. Seeking to understand the world as they see it. 
* Being ready to speak out against racism in action.
* Working with other white people. Finding the people who want to listen, who want to do the work to work against the racism our society is built on.
* "Reinvent reality," or repeating the words I want to see other white people saying. Normalizing that Black lives matter, that they are needed and loved. I perform this mostly on Facebook, where my friends are mostly older and white.
* Being available to help other white people by encouraging them to ask me questions instead of having them bother Black people.
