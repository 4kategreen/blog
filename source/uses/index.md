## Tech
* Phone: iPhone 12 mini
* Tablet: iPad Pro with a Pencil
* Laptop: MacBook Air 13‚Äù
* [Withings](https://www.withings.com/us/en/) for body tracking, though I don't love its overall integration into the Apple Health world. At the same time, from a privacy perspective, maybe that's okay
	* Steel HR (from 2017 and still ticking along). Waiting (kinda) patiently for a ScanWatch
	* Body+ scale
	* Sleep

## Apps
* For workouts, [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app)

* Meditation. I use Deepak Chopra's [app](https://www.chopra.com/app)
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/three/) to organize my todos
* [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app) for git and text editing on my iPad

## Leadership
My philosophy is based on relationships, setting my teams up for success, and being as transparent as possible. Most of my approach comes from my education background and experience with some very good leaders. However, these are the books I've added the most from:
* Brene Brown's [Dare to Lead](https://daretolead.brenebrown.com/)
* Lara Hogan's [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com/)

## Exercise
* For yoga, Adriene Mischler's [Find What Feels Good](https://yogawithadriene.com/) app
* Polar M400 watch
* [Polar OH1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PM6JDZ8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_tai_pL7MEbZ6ZJDV2) Bluetooth ANT+ heart rate monitor
* [Nike Training Club](https://www.nike.com/ntc-app) for quick workouts and yoga sessions

## Garden
* [Seed Savers Exchange](https://seedsavers.org) for almost all my seeds
* [Best Hand Shovel/Hoe/Weeder I've Ever Used](https://www.seedsavers.org/left-handed-nejiri-gama-hoe)
* LED Growlight to start seeds

## Dogs
If you're looking for a place to train your dog, find a place that will help you teach your dog and set them up for success. There's no need to be violent or mean to teach. If you need help and you're not local to me, please reach out and I can find someone.

When I compete in agility, I mostly do [NADAC](https://www.nadac.com) and [UKI](https://ukagilityinternational.com) right now.

### Local to Me in Maryland

* For fear and reactivity, Amy Cook's [Dealing with the Bogeyman](https://www.fenzidogsportsacademy.com/index.php/courses/84)

## Parenting
My philosphy is to encourage open-ended play, lots of physical movement, and be sure my children get the sleep and emotional support and safety they need to thrive. I model my parenting after Unschooling and John Holt's teachings, as well as the very precise method of "Doing Mostly the Opposite of What my Parents Did."

Things I rely on are:
* Creative toys: Legos, blocks, Brio trains
* Limited exposure to screens of all kinds
* The [Happiest Baby](https://www.happiestbaby.com/collections/books-dvds-more) books
* [How to Listen So Your Kids Will Talk](https://fabermazlish.com/)

## Anti-Racism
* [So You Want to Talk about Race](http://www.ijeomaoluo.com/)
